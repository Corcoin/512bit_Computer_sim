# 512bit_Computer_sim

512-bit computer
This project aims to create a simulated 512-bit computer using basic logic gates and transistors. The computer is designed to perform arithmetic and logic operations on 512-bit binary numbers.

## Features

- Simulated architecture based on basic logic gates
- ALU supporting addition and subtraction of 512-bit numbers
- Control unit for executing instructions
- Memory for storing data and instructions
